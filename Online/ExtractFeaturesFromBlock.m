function [EEG_Features, AllDataInFeatures] = ExtractFeaturesFromBlock(recordingFolder)
%% This function extracts features for the machine learning process.
% It loads a preprocessed chunk, the selected features indexes from
% the offline phase, and extracts the same features to be selected
% using these indexes.
