% This is a script to automate training a model. The steps to follow are:
% 1. Record using the MI1_Training function raw recordings using as many recording as
% needed. (Run function file to record, not this script).
% 2. Change the eeglab path in line 17
% 3. Alter the recordings array in line 23. Each element of the array
% specifies if to aggregate raw recording or feautes extracted fron an
% online session.
% 4. Alter parameters as needed.

% so on - but please cite properly if published.

%% VERY IMPORTANT- The parameters should be kept in sync with the online
