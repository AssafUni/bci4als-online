% this script finds the best preproccesing parameters for a given model.
% just supply a desired range of values for each parameter and run the 
% script, it will return the best set of parameters.
% the model is trained with the same train, val and test sets each time but
% with different parameters set.
% the script saves every trained model with its accuracy on each set
% (predictions are done by the default classification function of the
% model).
% you can then choose between models with best performances and change their
% classification function (based on the scores of the model) to fit your
% needs.
