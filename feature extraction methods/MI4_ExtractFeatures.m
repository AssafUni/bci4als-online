function features = MI4_ExtractFeatures(recordingFolder, flag_save)
%% This function extracts features for the machine learning process.
% It takes the segmented data and extracts the power in each label
% into a variable which is fed into a modeling function.

% This code is part of the BCI-4-ALS Course written by Asaf Harel
% and edited by Team 1
% (harelasa@post.bgu.ac.il) in 2020. You are free to use, change, adapt and
% so on - but please cite properly if published.

% The function uses the preproccessed data to extract features. It supports
% two modes:
% 1. Extract features from one recording
% 2. Aggregate data from previous recordings & if used with this function
%    in order iteratively aggregate many recordings together into the
%    %recordingFolder%. 
% The parameters of the functions are as follows:
% 1. The current recording folder
% 2. The last(if first then leave empty combined with mode = 0) recording
%    folder. The last folder is the result of all the previous aggregated
%    recording.
% 3. The mode to select features. 0 for select using
%    neighborhood component analysis, or 1 to use $Feature2SelectFile$
%    as a file that stores a vector of features numbers to select.
% 4. The mode to aggregate previous recording ot not to aggregate and
%    use only current recording. 0 to use only current recording and
%    1 to aggregate all previous recordings.
% 5. Whether to generate only power bands features or not. 0 for all
%   features and 1 for only power bands features.
% 6. Plotting options.
